                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Purpose:</strong> This project combines the concepts of Machine Learning with Cloud Computing in order to host a remote AI that can predict given stocks. This allows anyone who signs up to remotely predict the stock they want without having to download the program and use their machineâ€™s resources during the calculations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Capabilities:</strong> The Stock Trading AI can receive a given ticker with a start date and predict the next day's price by giving this information to the model. The web program can take this information and display it to the user while also sending it to the remote database.
